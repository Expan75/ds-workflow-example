Hey there!

This repo is made to showcase my ability to step through the data science pipeline, from inital data wrangling/cleaning to
descriptive analytics & predictive model application + evaluation.

Different files & Their purpose:

wrangler.py - wrangles two seperate data sources into one (a log file and a csv).

descriptive.py - performs descriptive statistics as well as visualisation in an effort to evaluate & explore.

model.py - applies logistic regression for predictive analytics purposes as well as rudimentary evaluation of the result.

For any questions, don't hestitate to send an email to:
