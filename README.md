## Hey there!

This repo is made to showcase my ability to step through the data science pipeline, from inital data wrangling/cleaning to
descriptive analytics & predictive model application + evaluation.


## Different files & Their purpose:

- <b>wrangler.py</b>  - wrangles two seperate data sources into one (a log file and a csv).

- <b>descriptive.py</b>  - performs descriptive statistics as well as visualisation in an effort to evaluate & explore.

- <b>model.py</b> - applies logistic regression for predictive analytics purposes as well as rudimentary evaluation of the result.

NOTE: to run any of the above, install Python (these scripts were run using python3.6) and install the required dependencies via pip:
	
	
	$ pip install -r requirements.txt
